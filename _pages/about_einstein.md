Hi I am Zhengtao Ma (马正涛). I'm a first-year (2024-) PhD student in the BWM Group + QUT Design Academy, Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane), supervised by Dr. Rafael Gomez and Prof. Ronald Schroeter. 

My research in human-computer interaction dive into designing interactions in Automated Vehicles, with a particular focus on improving the accessibility of Fully Automated Vehicles. 

I earned my M.Sc (Multimedia) from Hong Kong PolyU and B.Eng (Machenics) from Tianjin University (China). I was a research assistant under the supervision from Prof. Stephen J. Wang at the Future Mobility Center of PolyU.  

I like running, cycling, playing football, tennis and MMA.
