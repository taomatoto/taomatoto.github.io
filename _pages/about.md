Hi I am Zhengtao Ma (马正涛). I'm a first-year (2024-) PhD student in the [BWM Group + QUT Design Academy](https://www.bmwgroupqutdesign.academy/), Queensland University of Technology (Brisbane), supervised by <u>Dr. Rafael Gomez</u> and <u>Prof. Ronald Schroeter</u>. 

My research in human-computer interaction dive into designing interactions in Automated Vehicles, with a particular focus on improving the accessibility of Fully Automated Vehicles. 

I earned my M.Sc (Multimedia) from [Hong Kong PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and B.Eng (Machenics) from [Tianjin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_University) (China). I was a research assistant under the supervision from <u>Prof. Stephen J. Wang</u> at the Future Mobility Center of PolyU.  

I like running, cycling, playing football, tennis and MMA.
